Create a console application for a game in which one player moves a single piece around a chessboard.
Other than the use of a chessboard, there are no similarities between this game and chess.
Instead, the rules of the game are as follows:
• The board is 8 by 8 in size.
• Game activity is reported in the console.
• A player starts on the bottom-left square.
• A player can move their piece up, down, left or right one square by entering U, D, L, or R
respectively.
• A random number of squares are 'landmines’.
• The aim of the game is to get to the top side of the board without hitting more than two
landmines.
• Following each move, the game displays the new location and whether any landmines were
hit, plus whether the game has been lost (more than two land mines hit) or won (reached
the top of the board).
Additional Features:
• Represent the game visually in the console window
• High scores (best performance, fewest moves)
• Report of shortest path possible at the end of each game.
The game should be written in a manner that ensures the game can be extended in the future without
compromising development efficiency or quality. A front end isn’t needed, but one could be provided
in any technology.
